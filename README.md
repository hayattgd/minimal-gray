Try using my [themesw (Theme-switcher)](https://github.com/hayattgd/Theme-switcher) so you can easily switch between themes!

### Important

hyprland.conf contains multi-monitor setup with up and down.
please edit hyprland and kitty config, it sources `~/hyprland-bind.conf` and `~/kitty-bind.conf`, so if you wont set binds properly, you may be unable to start anything.
