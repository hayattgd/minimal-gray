Try using my [themesw (Theme-switcher)](https://github.com/hayattgd/Theme-switcher) so you can easily switch between themes!

### Monitor

hyprland.conf contains multi-monitor setup with up and down.

### Thing to edit

Setup your own key-binds on `~/hyprland-bind.conf` and `~/kitty-bind.conf`.

Change `hay-IPhone` to your phone name in `config/waybar/IPhone.sh` or delete it if you wont use it.
